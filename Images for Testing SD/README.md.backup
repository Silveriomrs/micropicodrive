# Description of Images (MDV & MDP)
## _Images served for testing purpose_

The microdrives images presented here are only for testing purpose. Thus you can find software ready to load into your QL system and others that need some works with MDTools (From Dr. Gusman) or another similar.

In particular PSION software is not prepared yet to be loaded successfully in a real QL (but Abacus). 

The idea is to give few images to play around directly with QL and enjoy the MicroDrivePico solution (also name here as MPD). Others to learn to control the MDTools and how the QL ecosystem fight between different formats and issues from a highly complex legacy reasons.

If you are new in QL ecosystem, be aware that due to some OS treatment with storage systems (MS Windows mainly) it requires some "headers" or extra info related with data space and "Magic Fields" that exceed the purpose of this info. All that can be solved with the mentioned tools above.

Also, for newbies there is a empty and formmated image that you can use (copy and paste) to use like real Microdr

I hope you are enjoying this beautiful solution. :)
